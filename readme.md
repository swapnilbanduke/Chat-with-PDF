# 💡 Prompt Engineering vs. RAG vs. Fine-Tuning — What’s the Real Difference?

When we dive into Large Language Models (LLMs), three terms always pop up:

1️⃣ **Prompt Engineering** – Craft smart, structured prompts to steer the model’s output *without* changing the model itself.

2️⃣ **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – Pull in real-time context (e.g., snippets from PDFs, websites, or databases) and let the model blend that knowledge into its answer.

3️⃣ **Fine-Tuning** – Train the model on domain-specific data so it “speaks” your business language out of the box.

To feel the differences in practice, here’s a mini-demo concept that lets you switch between approaches:

* ✅ **Prompting tab**: Experiment with instructions and watch answers shift.
* ✅ **RAG tab**: Upload a PDF and ask questions—the app retrieves the most relevant chunks before answering.
* ✅ **Fine-Tuning (optional)**: Try a lightweight model trained on niche data and compare tone & accuracy.

> Tip: Use Prompting when you need fast iteration, RAG when you need fresh/grounded facts, and Fine-Tuning when you need consistent brand/Domain tone and task-specific reliability.

# 📄 Chat-with-PDF (Streamlit + Sentence-Transformers + OpenAI)

Ask questions about any text-based PDF and get answers **grounded in its content**. Powered by a lightweight **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** stack:

* ✅ **Streamlit 1.34+** with native chat UI
* ✅ **Sentence-Transformers** for embeddings
* ✅ **NumPy + scikit-learn** for similarity search
* ✅ **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** (or compatible) for response generation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1) Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-with-pdf.git
cd chat-with-pdf

# Option A: Conda (recommended)
conda create -n pdfchat python=3.10 -y
conda activate pdfchat
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Option B: venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Set your API key

Create a file named **.env** in the project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

> You can also export `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell instead of using a `.env` file.

### 3) Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the local URL shown in your terminal.

## 🔧 How It Works (RAG Flow)

1. **Upload PDF** → the app extracts text and chunks it.
2. **Embed chunks** → using Sentence-Transformers.
3. **Retrieve** top-*k* similar chunks for your question (scikit-learn cosine similarity).
4. **Generate** an answer with GPT, **citing**/grounding in retrieved chunks.

This keeps answers tied closely to the PDF content and reduces hallucinations.

## 🧩 Optional: Compare Prompting, RAG, and Fine-Tuning

If you want the *tabbed* experience mentioned above, you can add a simple UI wrapper in `app.py` using Streamlit tabs:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(page_title="LLM Modes: Prompting / RAG / Fine-Tune")
mode_tabs = st.tabs(["Prompting", "RAG", "Fine-Tune"])  # wire your existing RAG code to the RAG tab

with mode_tabs[0]:
    st.markdown("**Prompting**: Provide system/user prompts and run the base model.")
    # 👉 Add a textarea for system prompt, another for user prompt, then call the base model.

with mode_tabs[1]:
    st.markdown("**RAG**: Upload a PDF and ask questions grounded in retrieved chunks.")
    # 👉 Reuse your current Chat-with-PDF flow here.

with mode_tabs[2]:
    st.markdown("**Fine-Tune**: Talk to a lightweight fine-tuned model.")
    # 👉 Swap model name to a fine-tuned endpoint or local model.
```

> Keep the RAG implementation as-is and mount it under the **RAG** tab. Add minimal UI for **Prompting** and switch your model name/endpoint for **Fine-Tune**.

## 🔐 Privacy & Limits

* PDFs are processed locally in-session; API calls send only the **retrieved chunks + your question** to the LLM.
* For large PDFs, consider chunking strategies (e.g., 800–1200 tokens with overlap) and caching embeddings.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Ideas

* Add **source highlighting** and in-text citations.
* Swap similarity to **FAISS** or **LanceDB**.
* Support **multi-document** RAG.
* Add **OpenAI responses with JSON schema** for structured outputs.
* Optional **Azure/OpenAI/Anthropic** model backends.
